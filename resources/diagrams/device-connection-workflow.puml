skinparam wrapMessageWidth 200

participant "Microcontroller Unit" as MCU
boundary    "Gateway" as Gateway
database    "etcd" as Etcd

== Connection Initiation ==

MCU ->> Gateway: Initiate TLS connection with client authentication
activate MCU
activate Gateway
note right of MCU: Device presents its UUID and public key in TLS handshake.

== Authentication Phase ==

Gateway -> Etcd: Query ~~Device~~ public key for UUID

alt Device and public key found
    Etcd --> Gateway: Return ~~Device~~ public key
    note left of Gateway: Follow **Verification Phase**
else Device or public key not found
    Gateway ->> MCU: Connection rejected
end

== Verification Phase ==

Gateway -> Gateway: Verify TLS client authentication using public key

alt Authentication Successful
    Gateway -> Etcd: Update ~~Device~~ status\n//Connected//
    Gateway ->> MCU: Connection established successfully
    note right MCU: Follow **Session Phase**
else Authentication Failed
    Gateway ->> MCU: Connection rejected - Authentication failed
end

== Session Phase ==

loop While connected
    MCU ->> Gateway: Periodic heartbeat with status
    Gateway -> Etcd: Update ~~Device~~\nLast heartbeat time
    ...30 seconds...
end

== Disconnection ==

alt Graceful Disconnection
    MCU ->> Gateway: Disconnect notification
    Gateway -> Etcd: Update ~~Device~~ status\n//Disconnected//
    Gateway --> MCU: Acknowledge disconnection
else Connection Lost
    note right of Gateway: Heartbeat timeout detected
    Gateway -> Etcd: Update ~~Device~~ status\n//Unreachable//
end

deactivate Gateway
deactivate MCU
