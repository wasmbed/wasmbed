title Device Enrollment Workflow

skinparam wrapMessageWidth 200

actor       "Administrator" as Admin
boundary    "Kubernetes API Server" as KubeApi
participant "Microcontroller Unit" as MCU
boundary    "Gateway" as Gateway
database    "etcd" as Etcd

== Pairing Mode Activation ==

Admin -> KubeApi: Enable pairing mode
note right of Gateway: Gateway now accepts new device enrollments.
note right of Gateway: Precise mechanism to be defined yet.

== Device Initialization Phase ==

MCU -> MCU: Generate keypair
activate MCU

== Enrollment Phase ==

MCU ->> Gateway: Initial connection request with enrollment flag
activate Gateway
Gateway -> Etcd: Check if pairing mode is enabled

alt Pairing Mode Active
    Etcd --> Gateway: Pairing is enabled
    note right of Gateway: Follow **Registration Phase**
else Pairing Mode Inactive
    Etcd --> Gateway: Pairing is disabled
    Gateway ->> MCU: Enrollment not allowed
end

== Registration Phase ==

Gateway -> Etcd: Create ~~Device~~\n//Enrolling//
Gateway --> MCU: Accept enrollment request
MCU ->> Gateway: Send public key
Gateway -> Etcd: Update ~~Device~~\nStore public key
Gateway ->> MCU: Send ~~Device~~ UUID
MCU -> MCU: Store UUID and keypair in non-volatile memory
MCU ->> Gateway: Send acknowledge
Gateway -> Etcd: Update ~~Device~~\n//Enrolled//
Gateway ->> MCU: Enrollment successful
MCU -> MCU: Exit enrollment mode
deactivate MCU
deactivate Gateway
